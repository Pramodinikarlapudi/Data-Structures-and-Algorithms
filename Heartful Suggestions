Hi People ðŸ‘‹
If you're just starting your journey into Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA),  
Or You're in your early years of undergrad, then you've come to the right place. 
I am currently in my Final year of my undergraduation in computer science.  
I've been where you are, and I know it can be a bit overwhelming.  
But trust me, with the right mindset, you'll navigate through this like a pro.  

Here's what i think will really help you get the most out of your undergraduation journey, exciting and fruitful.

1. Start taking care of your Linkedin profile from the initial days (EVERYONE KNOWS BUT VERY FEW IMPLEMENT)
-> Not like you have to gain expertise inorder to post it on linkedin, say you have read an interesting article related to technologies  
   you plan to work on or working on, share the link to the article and write your thoughts. This is not PROFILE BUILDING LITERALLY but  
   helps you get in touch with the platform in general.
